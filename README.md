3D printed Arduino based lamp, made to show your favourite streamer status. 

## Description

The python script provides the menu where you can select serial port to communicate with Arduino and edit the list of streamers to follow and color in which the lamp should light up when the streamer is online.
Arduino communicates with a python script through a serial port. The python script uses Twitch API to gather streamer status and sends information about the color in which the lamp should light up.
